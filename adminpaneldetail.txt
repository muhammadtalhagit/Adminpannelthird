To design a navigation bar for the Symphony Ltd. online portal, you can create two separate navigation systems: one for general users (students and visitors) and one for the admin. Below are the suggested tabs for the navigation bars along with a step-by-step flow for each type of user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To design an effective database schema for the admin panel of Symphony Ltd.'s online portal, we need to ensure it supports all required functionalities for managing courses, entrance exams, student results, FAQs, and center details. Below is a suggested schema for the database:

### **Database Schema**

#### **Tables**

1. **Courses**
   - `CourseID` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
   - `CourseName` (VARCHAR(255), Not Null)
   - `CourseDescription` (TEXT)
   - `CourseDuration` (VARCHAR(50))
   - `CourseFees` (DECIMAL(10, 2))
   - `TopicsCovered` (TEXT)

2. **EntranceExams**
   - `ExamID` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
   - `ExamDate` (DATE)
   - `ExamFees` (DECIMAL(10, 2))
   - `ExamDetails` (TEXT)

3. **Students**
   - `StudentID` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
   - `Name` (VARCHAR(255), Not Null)
   - `RollNumber` (VARCHAR(50), Unique, Not Null)
   - `Email` (VARCHAR(255))
   - `PhoneNumber` (VARCHAR(20))
   - `Address` (TEXT)

4. **StudentResults**
   - `ResultID` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
   - `StudentID` (Foreign Key, INT, References `Students(StudentID)`)
   - `ExamID` (Foreign Key, INT, References `EntranceExams(ExamID)`)
   - `Marks` (DECIMAL(5, 2))
   - `ClassAssigned` (VARCHAR(50))
   - `FeesDue` (DECIMAL(10, 2))
   - `PaymentDeadline` (DATE)

5. **FAQs**
   - `FAQID` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
   - `Question` (TEXT)
   - `Answer` (TEXT)

6. **Centers**
   - `CenterID` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
   - `CenterName` (VARCHAR(255))
   - `Address` (TEXT)
   - `PhoneNumber` (VARCHAR(20))
   - `Email` (VARCHAR(255))

7. **Payments**
   - `PaymentID` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
   - `StudentID` (Foreign Key, INT, References `Students(StudentID)`)
   - `PaymentType` (ENUM('Cash', 'Cheque', 'DD'))
   - `PaymentAmount` (DECIMAL(10, 2))
   - `ReceiptNumber` (VARCHAR(50))
   - `PaymentDate` (DATE)

8. **CourseRegistrations**
   - `RegistrationID` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
   - `StudentID` (Foreign Key, INT, References `Students(StudentID)`)
   - `CourseID` (Foreign Key, INT, References `Courses(CourseID)`)
   - `RegistrationDate` (DATE)

#### **Relationships**

- **Courses** and **CourseRegistrations**: A course can have multiple registrations.
- **Students** and **StudentResults**: A student can have multiple results (one for each exam).
- **EntranceExams** and **StudentResults**: Each exam can have multiple student results.
- **Students** and **Payments**: A student can make multiple payments.
- **Centers** and **Students**: A center can have multiple students, though this relationship might be indirect or managed through registrations.

#### **Database Schema Diagram**

Here's a conceptual representation of the database schema:

```plaintext

```

This schema ensures that all required data for managing courses, entrance exams, student information, and payments are captured and can be accessed or modified through the admin panel efficiently.
